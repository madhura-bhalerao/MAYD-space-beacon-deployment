# MAYD-space-beacon-deploymentObjective
Objective : 
Your objective is to deploy a Kubernetes cluster in your personal AWS Galaxy (account), and then deploy a "Space Beacon" microservice using Helm.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 1: Establishing the outpost foundation
In the Task1 repository, I have created a README.md file where you can find all the necessary files and instructions for setting up the foundation. This includes creating a VPC with a public subnet, setting up an EKS cluster, implementing security measures, and obtaining the EKS cluster coordinates.

Task 2: Docker - Building the Space Beacon
For Task2, I have created a README.md file in the Task2 repository. It contains detailed instructions on how to build the Space Beacon Docker image and push it into the container registry.

Task 3: Helm - Deploying the Space Beacon
In the Task3 repository, you will find all the necessary YAML files for deploying the Space Beacon using Helm. Additionally, there is a document that outlines the available additional elements that can be used during the deployment process.

Task 4: Deployment - Launching the Space Beacon & Documentation
For Task4, I have added a journey_log file in the repository. This log contains all the details and documentation related to the tasks completed during the deployment process.
