### Documentation - Mission Log, Guide for Future Space Engineers, Cosmic Anomalies, and Suggestions

## Journey Log

- Step 1: Set up the Terraform script to create the VPC and EKS cluster.
- Step 2: Deployed the Helm chart for the Space Beacon application to the EKS cluster.
- Step 3: Monitored the deployment and verified successful pod and service creation.

## Guide for Future Space Engineers

### Using the Terraform Script

1. Install Terraform on your local machine and ensure it is available in your system's PATH.
2. Obtain the necessary AWS credentials with sufficient permissions for VPC and EKS cluster creation.
3. Clone the mission control center repository containing the Terraform script.
4. Modify the `terraform.tfvars` file to specify the desired configuration.
5. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
6. Run `terraform plan` to review the planned infrastructure changes.
7. Run `terraform apply` to create the VPC and EKS cluster.

### Docker Image Creation and Push to Container Registry:

1. Develop your application code (e.g., in Python, Node.js, etc.) that listens on port 80 and responds to HTTP GET requests with the desired message.
2. Create a Dockerfile similar to the provided example, making sure to copy your application code into the container and expose port 80.
3. Build the Docker image using `docker build -t <your_image_name> .`_ , replacing <your_image_name> with the desired name for your Docker image.
4. Tag the Docker image with the appropriate registry name, e.g., `docker tag <your_image_name> <your_registry>/<your_repository>:<tag>.`
5. Push the tagged image to the container registry using `docker push <your_registry>/<your_repository>:<tag>.`

### Using the Helm Chart

1. Ensure you have the kubeconfig file generated by Terraform during the EKS cluster creation.
2. Set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to the path of the kubeconfig file.
3. Clone the mission control center repository containing the Helm chart.
4. Edit the `values.yaml` file to customize any configuration parameters.
5. Deploy the Helm chart to the EKS cluster using `helm install`.
6. Monitor the deployment using `kubectl` commands.

## Cosmic Anomalies

1. Dependency Installation: 
   The Space Beacon application didn't require any additional dependencies. However, if your application requires dependencies, make sure to include the necessary installation steps in the Dockerfile or Helm chart.

2. Image Pull Policy: 
   Ensure that the image pull policy in the Helm chart `(values.yaml)` matches your requirements. By default, it is set to `IfNotPresent`, which pulls the image only if it doesn't exist locally.

3. Security Considerations: 
   In a production-grade deployment, make sure to follow security best practices, including secure management of secrets, proper access controls, and encryption of sensitive information.

## Thoughts and Suggestions for Future Galactic Missions

Here are some thoughts and suggestions for future galactic missions:

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Continue using IaC tools like Terraform to provision infrastructure resources in a reproducible and consistent manner, enabling easy management and scalability.

2. **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):** Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, testing, and deployment of your Space Beacon application, ensuring rapid and reliable software releases.

3. **Observability and Monitoring:** Enhance observability by incorporating robust monitoring, logging, and alerting solutions into your deployment, enabling better visibility and proactive issue detection.

4. **Load Testing and Performance Optimization:** Perform load testing on the Space Beacon application to validate its performance under high loads. Optimize the application and infrastructure as needed to ensure optimal performance.

5. **Scaling Strategies:** Evaluate different scaling strategies based on expected traffic patterns. Consider using Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) and Cluster Autoscaler to automatically adjust resources based on demand.

6. **Disaster Recovery and High Availability:** Implement disaster recovery and high availability mechanisms to ensure the Space Beacon application remains available even in the event of failures or disruptions.
